## Handy Notes - C++ Concepts and Best Practices

### System-wise Memory Allocation
**Different memory allocations grant data different lifetimes.**  
There are 4 different memory partitions in execution:
* **Source code**: **read-only** and shared binary file generated by compiler
  * compile time
  * read-only: prevent writing access while executing `.exe`
  * shared: only contains one instance of executable file
* **Global**: static variables and functions
  * compile time
  * `const`s, `const string`s, `static`s and others  
    (constant global/scoped variables)
  * managed by compiler
* **Stack**: contains data managed by compiler
* **Heap**: contains data managed by developer

### Static VS. Dynamic Memory Allocation
* **Static**: compile-time, stored in Stack
* **Dynamic**: run-time, stored in heap

### Do **Not** Return References to Local Variables on Stack

```C++
#include <iostream>

/* Returning a pointer to a local stack variable is bad practice. */
int* func() {
  int a = 10;
  return &a; // void pointer will be yield
} // variable a goes out of scope, deleted by Compiler

int main(void) {
  int* p = func();
  std::cout << *p << std::endl; // OK; reserved by compiler
  std::cout << *p << std::endl; // ERROR without exception! void pointer

  system("pause");
  return 0;
}
```
