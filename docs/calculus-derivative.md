# Basic Derivatives

## Definition of Derivative

$$\lim_{\delta x\to\ 0} \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\delta x\to\ 0} \frac{f(x0 + \delta x) - f(x0)}{\delta x} $$

$$\delta x =h $$

$$\lim_{h\to\ 0} \frac{f(x0 + h) - f(x0)}{h} $$

$$ f'(x) = \lim_{h\to\ 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} $$

## Approach from Left and Right

Suggest that f(x) is derivable on open range `]a, b[`, therefore:

At left end a,
$$ f'(a) $$
approaching from the right hand side exists.

At right end b,
$$ f'(b) $$
approaching from the left hand side exists.

Thus f(x) is derivable on close range `[a, b]`.
