# Definition of Discontinuity

In calculus, a discontinuity refers to a point or set of points where a function fails to be continuous.

- In other words, there is a disruption or break in the function's graph at that point.
- You have to lift your pen up from the paper for at least once when drawing the graph for this function.

# Types of Discontinuity

- Removable Discontinuity
  - At a point of removable discontinuity, the function has a hole or gap in its graph that can be "filled" by redefining the function at that point.
- Jump Discontinuity
  - At a point of jump discontinuity, the function approaches different finite values from the left and right sides of that point. There is a visible jump or gap in the graph.
- Essential Discontinuity
  - At a point of essential discontinuity, the function either approaches infinity (both +, -) or does not have a finite limit from either side.
